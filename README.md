Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

Hello, my webpage is a site for goldendoodle lovers. As I hope I have conveyed through the website, I firmly believe that goldendoodles are the best breed of dog. I do not currently have a goldendoodle, but when I am older, I plan to get an F1B goldendoodle named Charlie. My pages are the following:

index.html--This is the homepage; it has a background image of a goldendoodle taken from the internet, and my navigation bar. 

info.html--This is the page that conveys why I think goldendoodles are the best dogs and displays three photos of goldendoodles (formatted using the bootstrap columns feature). I found the information for my list from various online websites including the Goldendoodle Association of America. The photos of the goldendoodles are from the internet. 

charlie.html--this page contains a table of the different types of goldendoodles, and a few photos of goldendoodles. I also use the #table feature to set the border spacing of the table. 

mystyle.css--This is my styling page. It contains the code for the style and creation of my navigation bar (which I obtained using bootstraps), footer, table, headers, grids, and body.
